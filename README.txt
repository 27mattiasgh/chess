Hello, thanks for checking out my chess game :)

Before running anything, follow these instructions:



1 - Use File Explorer to navigate to the file folder in which this file is located. Right-click and select "Copy as path"  (an EXAMPLE is C:\Users\27mattiasgh\Desktop\chess )

2 - Open the command prompt and run the following command:

    cd {PATH COPY}
    
In my case, I use this command:

    cd C:\Users\27mattiasgh\Desktop\chess


3 - assuming there are no errors, run the following command:

    py -m pip install -r requirements.txt


You will see a lot of information being written into the terminal. 
Once this stops (hopefully without errors), you can open the main.py file and run it. It may take a while; the school computers are slow.



NOTES:

    1: When running analysis mode, a bunch of windows will appear. This is completely normal and is a result of multithreading implementation. Please don't attempt to close them.

    2: I am more than okay with you editing this program for your final project; ensure you understand classes and threading well.



Have fun :)
